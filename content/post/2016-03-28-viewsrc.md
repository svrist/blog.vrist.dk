At the bottom of each of the blog posts I now have a 
**[See the source]({{< viewsrc >}})** link. 
With hugo (and quite likely all other blog-enignes, what do I
know?) this is pretty straight forward:

## Implementation

For a site you can define global variables in
[`config.toml`](http://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/) and each Node, for
example a post has both [Frontmatter](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/)
is available per "post". All this is available in the templates which displays
the content:

```
{{ .Params.github_src }}/blob/master/content/{{ $.Path }}
```

and the concept of [partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/) helps 
getting such [a link included on all
posts](https://github.com/svrist/blog.vrist.dk/blob/master/layouts/partials/sharing.html#L14):

```
{{ with .Site.Params.github_src }}
<div style="float: right; " class="src share"> 
    <a href="https://github.com/{{ . }}/blob/master/content/{{ $.Path }}"
       class="src" title="See the source">
        See the source <span class="fa fa-code-fork"></span>
    </a>
</div>
{{ end }
```
## A small note

It's worth noting that for me to be able to recreate the link inside of the
actual .md of this post without manually entering it I had to enclose it in a
shortcode - in the name of reuse I thought I could use the same mechanism in
both the template and this post. No such luck. To get it into the post,
outside of the template system, I needed to use a shortcode. But shortcodes
don't work inside of templates - and it turns out the qualified paths to the
data wasn't exactly the same either:

[Viewsrc.html
shortcode:](https://github.com/svrist/blog.vrist.dk/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/viewsrc.html)
``` 
{{ with $.Page.Site.Params.github_src }}
https://github.com/{{ . }}/blob/master/content/{{ $.Page.Path }}
{{ end }}
```
