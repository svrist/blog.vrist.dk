    Last year I had my debut as triathlete &#8211; I wrote about it here: <a title="Last Years Post" href="http://blog.vrist.dk/2010/08/13/copenhagen-4184-triathlon/">Blogpost last-year</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This year I did that same race again. The hardcore numbers:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Swim: 7m 15s
    </li>
    <li>
      T1: 03m35s
    </li>
    <li>
      Bike: 28m05s
    </li>
    <li>
      T2: 03m09s
    </li>
    <li>
      Run: 18m12s
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    All in all  15minutes faster than last year, and still great fun. The major difference is that I have been practicing since last year. Lots and lots of swim, a new bike and a member ship of a triathlon club.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This year they changed bike ride to not include two loops which involved some cobblestones. Otherwise still great fun!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Swim: This year I had a wet suit! The wind was cold and the water not very warm, so I was very happy to snuggle in my rented <a href="http://ddtri.dk/product.php?id_product=242">nineteen pipeline suit</a>! I have been practicing my crawl technique pretty much since this time last year, so this year it was a breeze to actually do the front crawl all 400m&#8217;ers. Except for the part were I got confused and headed for the wrong buoy in the beginning I was plowing through the fields of breast-stroke-swimmers and ran for my bike. (I did not see any backstrokers this year :D)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Bike: Very uneventful ride. I got a giant defy 1 bike this april and I have mounted aero-bars so it was quite another experience this time around. Nobody to draft from and overtaking all the way! Great fun <img src="http://blog.vrist.dk/newwp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The run: Hard as all always but I felt stronger and was faster this year, not quite as lonely a run this year either. I believe that triathlon has gotten quite a hold of the danish population!
  </p>

    Great event. My main take-away was to think more about the layout of the transition area. I placed my bike in such a position that I had to run waaaaay to long in my biking shoes (got no triathlon-biking-shoes so I wield the shoes right after the swim and tun out of T1 in them)
