In order to get the old wordpress posts image gallery to work (like
[CPH:Triathlon]({{< relref "2015-02-20-cphtriathlon-race-report.md" >}})) I
decided to take on some [shortcodes](http://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes). They
look very much [Jinja
Macros](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#macros) which I know from
my `$dayjob` - which might turn out to be a bit confusing.

In essence my plan was to avoid too much boilerplate. At first i tried
generalizing the wordpress markup into a shortcode but I found it a bit hard
to get working. I didn't want to write lots of tags, I didn't want to repeat
the images declaration with and without the thumbnail size suffix (example: img-150x150.png)

## Implementation
In the end I ended up with a
[frontmatter](https://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/) flag:
{{< gist svrist 9749757e1db524da7933 >}}
which enabled the inclusion of the javascript etc. in the header.

And two shortcodes. [A wrapping
one](https://github.com/svrist/blog.vrist.dk/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/galleryimage.html)
that defines the prefix path of the images for the gallery and the number of 
columns.

{{< gist svrist c6a87ac6e60302de606b >}}

And a shortcode for each of the [images inside of the gallery](
https://github.com/svrist/blog.vrist.dk/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/galleryimage.html):
{{< gist svrist 23f468bf9bf87dec3c3d >}}

In use it looks like this:
{{< gist sbv-csis "250ae9e9124176181a53" >}}

Looking at it afterwards it doesn't seem of much, but during, I had to get
acquainted with many concepts. Two things stands out:

## Nested shortcodes

In order to actually propagate the variables from the wrapping/outer shortcode
and into the wrapped shortcodes I turned to [the forums for
help](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/shortcode-and-nested-shortcodes-with-variables/2874). 
It turns out that it wasn't available in hugo just as of yet - but before my
`replace .Inner "PREFIX" (.Get "prefix")` hack was done
[bep](https://github.com/bep) had already [merged a
solution](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1937) - I guess it will be
available in upcomming 0.16 release. It works by allowing the nested
shortcodes to access the parent shortcode context via `.Parent.Get "var"`.

When release my replace will go away and galleryimage will instead of `PREFIX`
have:

```
src="{{ $.Parent.Get "prefix" }}/{{ . }}-{{ $size }}.{{ $suffix }}" 
```

## Default value for missing variables

In [jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) [`| default`](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#default)
is pretty normal order of business. As I again [consulted the forums](https://discuss.gohugo.io/t/the-way-to-do-default-value-in-shortcode/2878) it turned 
out hugo had been looking for a solution to that problem as well. Again in
short order [a solution was proposed, reviewed and merged](
https://github.com/spf13/hugo/pull/1943).

When that is released my `or .Get "something" "other"` will be replaced with
```
.Get "something" | default "other"
```

All in all the community and response was pretty awesome. Highly recommended
:)
