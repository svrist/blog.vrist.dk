## Background

So, I figure RSS is more or less dead. When Google
[discontinued Google Reader in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader)
apparently due to declining following I was quite miffed. I might not have
been using my account much, but I had a lot of subscribed feeds (imported from
bloglines - I honestly don't remember why I switched away from bloglines
though). [Feedly luckily came through and picked up the
"slack"](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/15/priorities-keeping-the-site-up-and-adding-new-features/)
- I've been using feedly on and off since - off because I use twitter and
facebook etc. for "news" now a days like most other people - on because I like to
have a concentrated bunch of things to read. And I like to read tech things.

When I stumbled upon [slicedham.co](http://www.slicedham.co/) and saw that it
was page which collected and aggregated software engineering blogs it went
straight into my feedly. But then in then middle of February updates just
stopped comming through. I've since imported the opml from the (quite
actively)
curated gross list of RSS feeds from
https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs but never the less an idea had
formed. Partly sparked by a story I heard about "viral news research" done at
[SDU denmark](http://filip.journet.sdu.dk/ilike/). The main idea was to cross
reference posts from all major and minor newspaper's websites with the
facebook API counting views, clicks, comments etc. 2,4,8,16 etc. hours after
the publication:

## The idea

What if I took all the RSS feeds I find interesting, seeded by the
slicedham.co opml and try to sort and curate based on

- Facebook-info like the viralnews
- Twitter info (if possible) on the link
- In the end perhaps also try to factor in what I reject just from the
  headline. For example news on
  [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework) or "the future of
  PHP" etc.

The goal in the end is to either:

- Get better/more-relevant things to read

or at least

- Get a fun side project to play with

## How

I could either use it like a kata and use the idea to play with all the things
that I've thought, "hmm, that could be fun to try". For example Rust, Go,
Heroku, Docker etc. Or I could try to get it to actually be useful for reading
news :)

Currently I lean towards the latter and will try to get it done in something
that is front of mind: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL etc.

Hopefully it will be useful as material for writing stuff on this blog as
well.
