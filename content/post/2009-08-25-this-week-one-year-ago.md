I went running. 20minutes + 6 minutes of breaks spread through out. 2-4 kilometers.

6 weeks before this I went to the physiotherapist &#8211; again. Third time, overloaded knees &#8211; Patellar tendinitis. First problem, april 2007, second time march 2008.

This time I tried another physiotherapist, recommended to me and a specialist in sports injuries and elite sports. I am and was not elite in sports in any way but the feeling of going to a place where the focus was on sustainable continuous training and not on &#8220;patching until workable again&#8221; was fantastic!

The main focus point was: Your lungs and heart can get in great shape in a matter of weeks, where your tendons and cartilage needs months and your bones needs many months or years. You are currently at zero or below, start working your way up, but don&#8217;t expect that marathon within the next 2-5 years.

Today, one year later I ran 8km in 44 minutes. In a pure quantity view there is a long way from the 40+kms a week, with a weekend run for 22km in march 2007 and all the way down to 8km&#8217;s now, but I&#8217;m very proud that I have been able to stick to the plan &#8211; slow progress and continuous effort. Nothing is fixed, and I can always feel the edge of soreness, and I don&#8217;t believe that I will ever be able to get completely rid of the tender knees.

But today is a great day never the less!
