<a href="http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/8/" title="History of fast 1/sqrt" target="_blank">Beyond3D(Rys) wrote an article</a> (<a href="http://www.beyond3d.com/content/articles/15/" title="Part two" target="_blank">almost a series!</a>) about the history <a href="http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/9" title="CodeMaestro" target="_blank">of the magic fast inverse square root </a>found in for example the quake code. With the <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-quakes-fast-inverse-square-root/" title="Explantion1" target="_blank">explantions</a> it doesn&#8217;t seem quite that much as magic. <a href="http://www.mceniry.net/papers/Fast%20Inverse%20Square%20Root.pdf" title="Pdf with more explantion" target="_blank">As this pdf says, its not magic at all</a>(page2) <img src="http://blog.vrist.dk/newwp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

The history article is all about paying homage to the author(s) and finding the origin. And it really is very very slick way of doing it. The article even uses this as an example of why it&#8217;s good that games and software gets release as open source in some form.

### **I&#8217;m just wondering: Why isn&#8217;t there any comments in this very sleek code?**

  If it was me using Ã¼bercool constants for nice approximations in my code I sure would hope i would comment it!
