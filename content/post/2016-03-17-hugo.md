So, years ago, [Morten](https://m.lieba.ch/), provided me with a makefile and
som [m4
macros](https://m.lieba.ch/2003/07/01/weblog-entry-2003-07-01-14-25-45/)
stuff and I played around with that for generating the pages
for this blog back in the day. Then I switched back and forth between engines,
and settled on wordpress for the last many years. But now Morten
[mentioned](https://www.facebook.com/liebach/posts/10207488737792119) 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I get the feeling that one of his hobbies is
changing his blog-engine ;) That being said, who am I to talk?

#### Migrating from Wordpress

So to get started I researched how to migrate my posts out of the wordpress
that it lived in:

* https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter

Turns out my wordpress was a snowflake, but yay [GitHub](https://github.com) -
I could just [fix
it](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter/pull/22)

That was enough PHP to last me years!

After I ran that plugin I got a zip file with a lot of `.md` files:

```
├── about-2
│   └── index.md
├── post
│   ├── 2005-07-31-postfix-setup.md
│   ├── 2005-08-08-bookmarking.md
│   ├── 2005-08-11-latex-tricks.md
...
```

#### Using Hugo

Tinkerer as I am I never looked much at the file and the documentation of
hugo. I just [`dpkg -i hugo_0.15_amd64.deb`](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.15/hugo_0.15_amd64.deb)
and tried `hugo` from an extract of the zip. Turns out there is more to it than that.

Reading the quite good
[documentation](http://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/) I settled on "just"
using `hugo new site blog.vrist.dk`. With that I got an empty scaffold up and 
reading the docuementation further I figured that all those directories and
`.md` should actually just have been extracted under the `content` directory.

Then the time came to see the results. Just using `hugo server` doesn't really
yield much.

Turns out you need to (quite reasonably so when you think about it) either 
yourself specify how to render the Markdown or use a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io)

Browsing around I stumbled over [hugo-uno](http://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-uno/)
and went with that as a beginning.

#### The final touches

Not everythiny was quite ok, so I had to change static urls that pointed to 
images not imported, I've added a tags.html partial and so on, but all in all
it was quite painfree.

The most notable done was writing 
[shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes) for the "gallery" like
functionality [I did]({{< relref "2016-03-17-hugo.md" >}}) at my wordpress 
setup. It took some research - I guess my brain works in strange ways compared
to the way shortcodes was thought.

For example:

#### Conclusion

With all this niceness I might even write something every now and then.
