I got all these ideas in my head of things I would like to try. This is my wishlist/todo/nicetohave list:

  * Try out the possibilites of Amazon Web Services, including EC2, S3, SQS and SimpleDB if possible 
      * Whats the hype about?
      * What kind of effort does it take to make it scale
      * It should be as intelligent as possible. Ip&#8217;s, roles,dynamic scaling up/down, failover?
  * Theres so many interesting software &#8220;things&#8221; that I would love to fiddle with 
      * Scala on a appserver together with maybe groovy and java stuff
      * Glassfish
      * <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/edu/j-dw-java-kickstart-i.html?" title="websphere/db2 @ ibm" target="_blank">Websphere/DB2</a>
      * <a href="http://mule.mulesource.org/display/MULE/Home" title="Mule website" target="_blank">Mule ESB</a> or what about <a href="https://open-esb.dev.java.net/" title="Open ESB" target="_blank">Open ESB</a>
      * OSGi things

That should be able to keep me busy for a while <img src="http://blog.vrist.dk/newwp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
