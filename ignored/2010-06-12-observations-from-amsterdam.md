<div>
  Probably trivially obvious and can probably be attributed to my ignorance more than anything around Holland:
</div>

  * They really like to drink milk! I denmark we drink milk, but here it is offered for all meals, both at CWI and my <a href="http://www.stayokay.com/index.php?pageID=3207&hostelID=356023" target="_blank">hostel</a>
  * For some reason it is easier to get powder milk in your coffee than fresh milk. The mind boggles
  * They like their &#8220;fietsen&#8221; here. Bicycles almost as many as I see in copenhagen. I&#8217;ve seen a fair amount of normal city-bikes with <a href="http://www.bicycleeverything.com/product_images/p/569/profile_design_t2_cobra_carbon_bike_aero_bar__44623_zoom.jpg" target="_blank">aero-gear</a>. Most of the bikes are &#8220;granma-bikes&#8221;
  * It is true: Coffee-shops exist and you can walk in and buy hash
  * They are really really really looking forward to the football World Cup in South Africa.
  * They are very proud of their <a href="http://goamsterdam.about.com/od/planatrip/a/color_orange.htm" target="_blank">orange colors</a>. Football celebrations and elsewhere
  * Some of the houseboats looks really nice
  * June 9 was electionday for parliment. Very quiet. No posters, no marches, no demonstrations. Very quiet.
