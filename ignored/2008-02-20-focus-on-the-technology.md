As everybody knows, you need to take care of all technical desicions before designing or anything. So i&#8217;ve decided to use maven2 and eclipse for the project. (see <a href="/2008/02/19/toying-around/" title="Toying around" target="_blank">my last post</a>)

### Â Maven2:

I use maven at work, and I kinda got used to it. My expirence so far has been way more positive than my humble ant attemps during my <a href="/2006/06/20/afleveret-opgave/" title="Bachlor thesis blog post" target="_blank">bachlor thesis.</a> Thats a good reason, right?

### Eclipse:

I never used anything else than eclipse, so that was an easy choice. And I&#8217;m most certainly going to use <a href="http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/" title="eclipse checkstyle plugin" target="_blank">Checkstyle</a> and <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/eclipse.html" title="Findbugs eclipse plugin" target="_blank">Findbugs</a> and probably the <a href="http://eclipse-jutils.sourceforge.net/" title="Eclipse jutils website" target="_blank">eclipse-jutils project</a>. I know that there exists &#8220;EE&#8221; plugins for eclipse too, so I might get som help there too.

Yay. More decicions done!
