So, progress is slow, and currently I&#8217;m looking into the base &#8220;architecture&#8221; of the show. I&#8217;ve been looking into different ESB&#8217;s as in:

  * <a href="http://mule.mulesource.org/display/MULE/Home" title="Mule homepage" target="_blank">Mule</a>
  * <a href="https://open-esb.dev.java.net/" title="Open ESB homepage" target="_blank">OpenESB</a>
  * <a href="http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html" title="Apache ServiceMix" target="_blank">Apache ServiceMix</a>

Im pretty hooked on using SQS for queues which Mule supports out-of-the-box. On the other hand is it tempting to code it my self. But then again. Ill take ages to make it robust enough.

So currently I&#8217;m trying to choose between Mule or code-it-myself.  Today I&#8217;m on the Mule side <img src="http://blog.vrist.dk/newwp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
